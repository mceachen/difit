# @photostructure/difit

PhotoStructure's fork of [difit](https://github.com/yoshiko-pg/difit), originally by yoshiko-pg.

## What this fork adds

This fork builds on Yoshiko's diff viewer with a review workflow for coding agents:

- **Conversation drawer:** discuss the whole review alongside inline code threads,
  reply in either place, and retain drafts when moving between a discussion and code.
- **Live agent feedback:** submitted comments reach the agent immediately through
  JSON events; exact-thread replies appear in the viewer while the review continues.
- **Comment progress:** see Delivered, Read, Thinking, Replying, Replied, or Noted
  when the agent reports its activity. This does not wake an idle agent automatically.
- **Reversible LGTM:** approval stays visible and can be revoked. Conversations
  and the approval toggle are opt-in; approval starts off.
- **Questions and retained discussions:** label a thread as a question, resolve
  and reopen it without losing the history, or explicitly delete it.
- **Repository information:** expand the Repository info node in the file tree to
  see the reviewed repository, worktree, server, and launch directory. The browser
  title identifies the repository and port; the disclosure fits mobile screens.

The question marker and explicit thread deletion incorporate
[upstream PR #482](https://github.com/yoshiko-pg/difit/pull/482).
Reusable UI and conversation changes are being prepared as focused commits for
upstream; scoped packaging, publishing, and default flags belong to this fork.

## Run the PhotoStructure package

```sh
npx @photostructure/difit .
```

Live agent conversations and the reversible LGTM approval toggle are opt-in.
Approval starts off; click LGTM to approve or revoke. Use `--no-lgtm` for a read-only review
and `--no-conversation` to disable live events. `--lgtm` and `--ship-it` are aliases.
The agent must actively watch and answer comments; the viewer does not start an agent.
See [the agent conversation protocol](docs/agent-conversations.md).

Install with `npm install -g @photostructure/difit` to use the `difit` command.
Node.js 22.14 or newer is required. On other machines, verify the package version
with `npx @photostructure/difit --version` before beginning a review.

**difit** is a CLI tool that lets you view and review local git diffs with a GitHub-style viewer. In addition to clean visuals, comments can be copied as prompts for AI. The local code review tool for the AI era!

## ⚡ Quick Start

Try it first

```bash
npx @photostructure/difit  # View the latest commit diff in WebUI
```

Install and use

```bash
npm install -g @photostructure/difit
difit  # View the latest commit diff in WebUI
```

Enable use from AI agents

```bash
npx skills add photostructure/difit # Add the Skills to your agent
```

Installed skills include:

- `difit`: ask the user for a review in the difit viewer when the user explicitly opts in to difit
- `difit-review`: review a specific diff or PR and show the findings inside the difit viewer, when the user explicitly asks for difit

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
difit <target>                    # View single commit diff
difit <target> [compare-with]     # Compare two commits/branches
```

### Single commit review

```bash
difit          # HEAD (latest) commit
difit 6f4a9b7  # Specific commit
difit feature  # Latest commit on feature branch
```

### Compare two commits

```bash
difit @ main         # Compare with main branch (@ is alias for HEAD)
difit feature main   # Compare branches
difit . origin/main  # Compare working directory with remote main
```

### Special Arguments

difit supports special keywords for common diff scenarios:

```bash
difit .        # All uncommitted changes (staging area + unstaged)
difit staged   # Staging area changes
difit working  # Unstaged changes only
```

### GitHub PR

```bash
difit --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

`--pr` mode fetches patches by running `gh pr diff --patch` under the hood.
It also imports unresolved inline review threads from the PR so they appear as startup comments in difit.

Authentication is handled by GitHub CLI:

1. **Login once** (recommended): `gh auth login`
2. **Token-based auth** (CI/non-interactive): set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`

#### GitHub Enterprise Server

For Enterprise Server PRs, authenticate GitHub CLI against your Enterprise host:

1. `gh auth login --hostname YOUR-ENTERPRISE-SERVER`
2. Or set `GH_HOST=YOUR-ENTERPRISE-SERVER` with `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`

### Initial Comments

You can inject initial review comments when launching difit:

```bash
difit --comment '{"type":"thread","filePath":"src/example.ts","position":{"side":"new","line":10},"body":"The background for this change is..."}'
```

`--comment` is repeatable and accepts either a single JSON object or a JSON array. Supported types:

- `thread`: create a new thread at the specified diff position
- `reply`: add a reply to the latest existing thread at the same diff position

If the same comment already exists, difit skips importing it.

### Stdin

By using a pipe to pass unified diffs via stdin, you can view diffs from any tool with difit.

```bash
# View diffs from other tools
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt | difit

# Review saved patches
cat changes.patch | difit

# Compare against merge base
git diff --merge-base main feature | difit

# Review an entire existing file as newly added
git diff -- /dev/null path/to/file | difit

# Explicit stdin mode
git diff --cached | difit -
```

Stdin mode is selected with intent-first rules:

- `-` explicitly enables stdin mode
- If positional arguments (`<target>` / `[compare-with]`) or `--pr` are provided, difit treats the command as Git/PR mode and does not auto-read stdin
- Auto stdin detection applies only when no explicit mode is selected and stdin is a pipe/file/socket

## 💬 Comment System

difit includes a review comment system that makes it easy to provide feedback to AI coding agents:

1. **Add Comments**: Click the comment button on any diff line or drag to select a range
2. **Edit Comments**: Edit existing comments with the edit button
3. **Generate Prompts**: Comments include a "Copy Prompt" button that formats the context for AI coding agents
4. **Copy All**: Use "Copy All Prompt" to copy all comments in a structured format
5. **Persistent Storage**: Comments are saved in browser localStorage per commit

### Review-wide conversations

Open **Conversation** in the header to see the review's discussions in a side panel.
Start a general discussion there when feedback applies to the whole review rather
than one line. General threads support replies, editing, and Copy Prompt just like
inline threads, and are saved with the selected comparison. Click an inline thread
to jump to its code; general threads stay in the panel. Copy All and CLI comment
output include both kinds of discussion.

### Comment Prompt Format

```sh
src/components/Button.tsx:L42   # This line is automatically added
Make this variable name more descriptive
```

For range selections:

```sh
src/components/Button.tsx:L42-L48   # This line is automatically added
This section is unnecessary
```

## 🤖 Calling from Agents

You can install the following Skills to work with difit from AI agents.

```sh
npx skills add photostructure/difit
```

Installed skills include:

- `difit`: ask the user for a review in the difit viewer when the user explicitly opts in to difit
- `difit-review`: review a specific diff or PR and show the findings inside the difit viewer, when the user explicitly asks for difit

After code edits or automated review, the agent can start the difit server with the appropriate skill.

## 🎨 Syntax Highlighting Languages

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.svelte`
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, Markdown
- **Shell Scripts**: `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.fish`
- **Backend Languages**: PHP, SQL, Ruby, Java, Groovy, Scala, Perl, Elixir, Haskell, Clojure
- **Systems Languages**: C, C++, C#, Rust, Go

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (HCL), Nix
- **Others**: Python, Protobuf, YAML, Solidity, Vim script, GDScript

## 🔍 Auto-collapsed Files

difit automatically identifies and collapses certain files to keep your view clean:

- **Deleted files**: Removed files are auto-collapsed since they don't require close review
- **Generated files**: Auto-generated code is collapsed by default. This includes:
  - Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, etc.)
  - Minified files (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`)
  - Source maps (`*.map`)
  - Generated code:
    - Orval (`*.msw.ts`, `*.zod.ts`, `*.api.ts`)
    - Dart (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`)
    - C# (`*.g.cs`, `*.designer.cs`)
    - Protobuf (`*.pb.go`, `*.pb.cc`, `*.pb.h`)
  - Frameworks:
    - Ruby on Rails (`db/schema.rb`)
    - Laravel (`_ide_helper.php`)
    - Gradle (`gradle.lockfile`)
    - Python (`uv.lock`, `pdm.lock`)
  - Generic generated files (`*.generated.cs`, `*.generated.ts`, `*.generated.js`)
  - Content-based detection:
    - Files containing `@generated` marker
    - Files containing `DO NOT EDIT` header
    - Language-specific generated headers (Go, Python, etc.)

## Agent conversations

Use `difit <target> <base> --conversation --keep-alive` to let an agent
answer submitted comments while you continue reviewing. In another process,
`difit comment watch --port <port>` streams JSON Lines; `comment reply` sends
answers to the exact review thread. A bounded `comment watch --once` wait is
available for tool-driven agents. See [the conversation protocol and agent
workflow](docs/agent-conversations.md), including conditional LGTM approval.

## HTTPS and remote browsers

The browser's [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)
requires a secure context. Localhost is treated as trustworthy for local development;
a remote HTTP address such as `http://10.1.1.24:4966` generally is not. difit tries a
legacy copy fallback, but trusted HTTPS is the reliable setup for remote browsers.
Browser permissions can still prevent copying.

Start the built difit server on the machine containing the repository:

```sh
difit . --host localhost --port 4966 --no-open --keep-alive
```

Use the actual port printed at startup if 4966 is occupied. From a source checkout,
run `pnpm build`, then use `node dist/cli/index.js` in place of `difit`.
Proxy this server, which serves both the UI and `/api`, at the root of one HTTPS
origin. The development server (`pnpm dev`, usually port 5173) can embed a localhost
API address for event streams, so it is not the target for these recipes.

The proxy must stream Server-Sent Events (SSE) on `/api/watch` and `/api/heartbeat`
without buffering or caching. `--keep-alive` prevents a dropped browser connection
from ending the review. difit has no built-in login: anyone who can reach the
service can access the review and its enabled actions. Use an authenticated proxy
for private repositories; HTTPS alone does not restrict access.

### Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`)

For ongoing remote reviews, use a [named Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/)
with a hostname such as `review.example.com`, routed to service type HTTP at
`localhost:4966`. Configure a Cloudflare Access policy for the intended reviewers
before exposing private code, and open the resulting HTTPS hostname. Keep `/api/*`
uncached and confirm live updates using the checks below.

For a temporary preview, an installed `cloudflared` can create a Quick Tunnel:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4966
```

Open the HTTPS URL printed by the command. However, [Quick Tunnels do not support
SSE](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/), which
difit uses for live updates. They are unsuitable for the full conversation workflow:
a page loading and Copy working do not establish that replies or approval changes
will update live. The URL is public unless access restrictions are configured.

### localtunnel

With [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel), run a second process:

```sh
pnpm dlx localtunnel --port 4966 --local-host localhost
```

Open its printed HTTPS URL. This exposes the review through a third-party service;
use non-sensitive diffs for a public preview. Verify streaming replies and updates
before relying on a hosted tunnel for a review. Stop the tunnel when finished.

### local-ip.sh on a LAN

[local-ip.sh](https://local-ip.sh/) provides DNS names for IP addresses. For example,
`10-1-1-24.local-ip.sh` resolves to `10.1.1.24`. The reviewing device must be able to
reach that address; this does not create a tunnel or turn difit's HTTP server into
an HTTPS server.

Run a TLS reverse proxy on the repository machine. For example, with Caddy installed,
use this `Caddyfile`, replacing the address with that machine's LAN IP:

```caddyfile
https://10-1-1-24.local-ip.sh:8443 {
    tls internal
    reverse_proxy localhost:4966
}
```

Run `caddy run --config Caddyfile`, allow the reviewing device to reach port 8443,
and open `https://10-1-1-24.local-ip.sh:8443`. Caddy's `tls internal` uses a local CA;
install and trust its root certificate on each reviewing device before using the
page. Alternatively, configure a certificate trusted by those devices with Caddy's
[`tls` directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls).
[Caddy streams SSE responses](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy#streaming).

local-ip.sh also publishes a wildcard certificate and its private key. Because that
key is public, use your own certificate for private code. The hostname alone,
or bypassing a certificate warning, is not a substitute for trusted HTTPS.

### Check copying and live conversations

Open the HTTPS page without a certificate warning, click Copy Prompt, and paste
into a text editor. For conversations, add `--conversation` when starting difit
and run `difit comment watch --port 4966` on the repository machine. Submit a comment
from the remote browser, verify it appears in the local stream, then send a
[reply](docs/agent-conversations.md) and confirm it appears without refreshing.
Agent commands still connect to localhost on the repository machine; the browser
can use the HTTPS proxy. They do not acquire remote-host support from the URL.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (with hot reload)
# This runs both Vite dev server and CLI with NODE_ENV=development
pnpm run dev

# Build and start production server
pnpm run start <target>

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run typecheck, lint, and format
pnpm run check
pnpm run format
```

### Development Workflow

- **`pnpm run dev`**: Starts both Vite dev server (with hot reload) and CLI server simultaneously
- **`pnpm run start <target>`**: Builds everything and starts production server (for testing final build)
- **Development mode**: Uses Vite's dev server for hot reload and fast development
- **Production mode**: Serves built static files (used by npx and production builds)

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **CLI**: Commander.js for argument parsing with comprehensive validation
- **Backend**: Express server with simple-git for diff processing
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub CLI (`gh pr diff --patch`) for PR patch retrieval
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with GitHub-like dark theme
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Prism.js with dynamic language loading
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests with co-located test files
- **Quality**: oxlint, oxfmt, lefthook pre-commit hooks

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 21.0.0
- Git repository with commits to review
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for `--pr` mode
